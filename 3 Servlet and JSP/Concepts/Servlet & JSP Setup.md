### Prerequisites for Servlet Setup

To set up and run Java Servlets, you need to have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **JDK (Java Development Kit):**

   - **Purpose:** The JDK is essential for developing and running Java applications, including Servlets. It includes the Java compiler (`javac`), Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and essential libraries.
   - **Installation:** Download and install the latest version of the JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use a version manager like SDKMAN.

2. **Java EE (Jakarta EE):**

   - **Purpose:** Java EE (now known as Jakarta EE) is a set of specifications that extend Java SE with specifications for enterprise features such as web services, Servlets, and JavaServer Pages (JSP). While setting up Servlets, you'll need the Java EE libraries.
   - **Installation:** Many IDEs like Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA come with built-in support for Java EE. You can also manually include Java EE libraries in your project.

3. **Tomcat - Apache Server:**
   - **Purpose:** Apache Tomcat is a widely-used open-source web server and servlet container. It implements the Java Servlet and JSP specifications and provides an environment for running Java-based web applications.
   - **Installation:**
     1. Download the latest version of Tomcat from the [Apache Tomcat website](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi).
     2. Extract the downloaded zip file to a directory on your system.
     3. Configure your IDE (like Eclipse) to use Tomcat as a server, or run Tomcat independently from the command line.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment:

1. **Install JDK:**

   - Ensure the JDK is installed and configured properly. You can verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     java -version
     ```
   - This should display the installed Java version.

2. **Set Up Java EE Environment:**

   - If using an IDE, make sure you have the Java EE or Web Development version installed, which includes support for Servlets and JSP.

3. **Install and Configure Apache Tomcat:**

   - Once Tomcat is downloaded and extracted, you can integrate it with your IDE or start it manually using the startup scripts in the `bin` directory (`startup.bat` for Windows or `startup.sh` for Unix/Linux).

4. **Test Your Setup:**
   - Create a simple servlet, deploy it on Tomcat, and access it via your web browser to ensure everything is set up correctly.

This setup will enable you to develop, deploy, and run Java Servlet-based web applications efficiently.
