# JAVA JDBC (JAVA Database Connectivity)

Java Core : Stand Alone/Bacheolor Applications : The Applications which are running on a Single Machine are called Stand Alone Applications.
Eg: Calculator, MS Word
Any Core Java Application
If we want to develop Web Applications then we should go for Advanced Java.

The Applications which are providing Services over the Web are called Web Applications.
Eg: gmail.com, facebook.com.

---

Stand Alone Applications :

1. GUI(Desktop) based applications
2. CUI based applications

---

JDBC :: To communicate application with the Database
Servlets :: Processing logic
JSPs :: View Components / Presentations logic

Where ever Presentation Logic is required i.e. to display something to the End User then we
should go for JSP i.e. JSP meant for View Component.

Where ever some Processing Logic is required then we should go for Servlet i.e. Servlet meant for
Processing Logic/ Business Logic. Servlet will always work internally.

From Java Application (Normal Java Class OR Servlet) if we want to communicate with Database
then we should go for JDBC.
